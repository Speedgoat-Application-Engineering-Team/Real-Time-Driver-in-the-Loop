**About**

The Speedgoat Real-Time Driver-in-the-Loop Simulator demonstrates how to immerse the driver into compelling photorealistic 3D visualization environments in combination with the real-time simulation and high-fidelity capture of the vehicle dynamics, the behaviors of the tire and road surface. A gaming pedal and a steering wheel hardware are used for the driver input.

----------


**Learn how to:**

 - Use Vehicle Dynamics Blockset™ to model complex vehicle dynamics and driving maneuvers
 - Create real-time simulations of virtual vehicles with Simulink Real-Time™ and Speedgoat target hardware
 - Employ Simulink’s interface to Unreal Engine® and visualize driving scenarios
 - Set up a driving simulator with pedals and a steering wheel to perform driver-in-the-loop testing

----------

**Getting started**

 1. Open MATLAB and open Simulink Project file
 2. Click in 'Deploy application to target' project shortcut
 3. The host model "DriverInLoopGamingEngine.slx" opens, click "Run" to start the application
